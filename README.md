"Code challenge" 

Problem Statement
Create a small application that can calculate a department and/or manager’s monthly expense
allocation based on the number and types of employees reporting to the manager or contained within
the department.
Specific Requirements
  • Developers warrant an allocation of $1000 each.
  • QA Testers warrant an allocation of $500 each.
  • Managers warrant an allocation of $300 each.
  • Managers can have QA Testers, Developers, and other managers report to them.
  • Departments consist of any kinds of employees.
  • Users of this application should be able to:
o Determine the monthly expense allocation warranted a manager who has various
employee types reporting to him/her at least two levels deep (Manager -> Manager ->
Developer). The level of depth of the hierarchy should be flexible ideally.
o Determine the monthly expense allocation warranted a department with various
employee types under it at multiple levels deep just as the Manager can.
Example Scenario
• For the given hierarchy:
  o Manager A
    ▪ Manager B
      • Developer
      • QA Tester
• Manager A’s allocation should be: $2100
Project Details & Constraints
  • No user interface is necessary to prove your project solution works. You can prove it works with
Unit tests following whatever best-practices you deem appropriate.
  • The project should be zipped and emailed upon completion.
  • You may use any design patterns and frameworks you deem necessary to accomplish this task.
